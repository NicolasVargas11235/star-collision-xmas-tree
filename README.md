For Matt Parker's LED christmas tree project (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMRJf6B5Q4) I have created an animation showing 2 neutron stars colliding into each other, producing a kilonova. This is a tribute to the first neutron star collision detection, back in 2017. The animation was created in c#, using Rhino7 and Grasshopper. Two spheres mapped in 3D space follow a predetermined curve approximating a decaying orbit. The two jets exploding from the poles are created with growing cylinders along the z-axis. The final part of the explosion is created by mapping a torus, with both in its major and minor radius gradually expanding.
